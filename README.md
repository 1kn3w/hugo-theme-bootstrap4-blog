## Building (For Developers)
This theme uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) frameworks. Static versions of these are already included, but if you want to bump the versions, tweak the style, etc, you'll need to rebuild the assets. Make sure you have NodeJS v4 or v6 installed, and then run the following from inside the theme's directory:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
